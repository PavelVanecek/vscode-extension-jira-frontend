# Highlight atlaskit colors

```
import { colors } @atlaskit/theme
```

This folder highlights colors from atlaskit!

This is inspired (and reuses some come) by the vscode-colorize extension: https://github.com/KamiKillertO/vscode-colorize.

The colors source code is here: https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-mk-2/src/master/packages/core/theme/src/colors.js

And they are documented here: https://atlassian.design/guidelines/brand/color-1

... but isn't it nice to see them directly in your editor?
